\textbf{Background}: 
In software engineering there are several principles depending the outcome of a software project. If one applies these principles the wrong way, or don't take it into account, it can starve a software project. WIP-limit is of one those principles. There is little evidence proving the impact of limiting work-in-progress for software development.\\
\textbf{Aim}: 
The aim for this thesis is to investigate the impact of WIP - limits in software development. \\
\textbf{Methods}:
The methods used to investigate the research question were a case study of an in house software development company. The case study was based on a data set with recorded data from 2008 to 2013. The data set was interpreted with a program made for this thesis and the correlation and case summaries in SPSS.\\
\textbf{Results}:\\
The results show team size has an impact on both WIP and throughput. The results also show the impact both lead time and throughput has on a development process. 
\textbf{Conclusion}:\\
The conclusion is WIP-limit don't matter in software development.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
This master thesis focuses on limit Work In Progress (WIP), which is one of the principles in Kanban. The focus will be to see what impact WIP limit has in a development process. In order to do so, a data set gathered by an in house software company in Norway called Software Innovation (SI) was used. SI is a Scandinavian software company that delivers Enterprise Content Management applications.

The data set had already been interpreted by another study. That study investigated Scrum vs. Kanban for SI. For interested readers the case study can be found in the article "Quantifying the Effect of Using Kanban versus Scrum: A Case Study" \parencite{Dag}. 

\section{Motivation}
In software development, processes and methods are important in order to deliver the right product on time. In software development one rarely solves two identical problems for different stakeholders and the problems are getting bigger and more complex, which means that new processes and methods are introduced and the already existing processes and methods need to be adapted to solve the complex problems in the most efficient ways.  The number of popular software development methods  (e.g. Extreme programming, Spiral, Scrum and Kanban) emerged in the recent years proves this assumption \parencite{gandomani2013important} \parencite{ikonen2010exploring}.

This is why this thesis will focus on software development methods, the method in each development project is such a key element to make a project successful. The main focus of this thesis will be the Kanban method and the principle to limit Work In Progress (WIP). In Kanban the WIP limit is used to  limit the number of tasks each developer can work on at each workflow state to prevent bottlenecks and to ensure flow of tasks through the development cycle \parencite{gandomani2013important} \parencite{ikonen2010exploring}.

There are published various literature on Kanban in software development such as "Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business" \parencite{0984521402}, "Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both"  \parencite{Kniberg} and "Lean Software Management: BBC Worldwide Case Study" \parencite{Joyce}. Although there is various literature, there is no information on how to apply WIP limit, even though most of the experienced Kanban enthusiasts agree that WIP limit is an important principle.  There is no research backing this statement.  The literature states that one should experiment with WIP limits in order to find the best WIP limit for one's case \parencite{Ikonen} \parencite{Kniberg}.

Because there is lack of available research on WIP limit my motivation is to investigate WIP limit in this thesis.

\section{Research Question}
\label{chap:RQ}
In this thesis the overall research question will be to study the effects of WIP limits for an in house software company, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item Does WIP limit in software development matter?
%\item See if the exist an optimal WIP limit for a given context.
\item If so, how can one find the optimal WIP-limit?
\item Which parameters should be considered in order to optimize WIP-limits? 
\end{itemize}


\section{Approach}
This thesis will use case study as an approach  to answer the research questions. To conduct the case study a data set from an in house software company will be used.  The data set will be evaluated at team level. SI consists of ten teams, all of them will be investigated.

A software program was built for this thesis to transform the data set into more suited data, so SPSS could be used to perform statics analyze. The statics analyze will consist of computing correlation and descriptive statistic.

\chapter{Background}  
\label{chap:Background}                %% ... or Bakgrunn
In this chapter there will be a brief introduction to Waterfall (Section \ref{sec:WP}), Scrum (Section \ref{sec:Scrum}), Lean (Section \ref{sec:Lean}) and Kanban (Section \ref{sec:Kan}) with affiliated tools. The software development company Software Innovation is briefly introduced (Section \ref{sec:SI})

\section {Waterfall}
\label{sec:WP}
"The waterfall model is the classical model of software engineering. This model is one of the oldest models and is widely used in government projects and in many major companies" \parencite{munassar2010comparison}. The main goal of the waterfall model is to plan in early stages to ensure design flaws before coding is started. Since planning is so critical in the waterfall method it fits projects where quality control is a major concern  \parencite{munassar2010comparison}.

The waterfall method consists of several non-overlapping stages as shown in figure \ref{fig:waterfall}. The figure is an example of the waterfall model with a life cycle of establishing system requirements and software requirements and continues with architectural design, detailed design, coding, testing and maintenance  \parencite{munassar2010comparison}. One of the main principles of the waterfall method discourages return to an earlier phase. For example returning from detailed design to architectural design. However, if returning to an earlier phase is needed, it involves costly rework. When a phase is completed, the phase requires formal review and extensive documentation development. Therefore, if something is missed out an earlier phase, it is expensive to correct it later  \parencite{munassar2010comparison}


\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Picture/waterfall.jpg}
\caption{Waterfall model}
\label{fig:waterfall} % 
\end{figure}

\section {Scrum}
\label{sec:Scrum}
"Scrum is the best-known of the Agile frameworks. It is the source of much of the thinking behind the values and principles of the Agile Manifesto. These values are:

\begin{center}
\textbf{Individuals and interactions}  \textit{over processes and tools} \\
\textbf{Working software} \textit{over comprehensive documentation} \\
\textbf{Customer collaboration} \textit{over contract negotiation} \\
\textbf{Responding to change} \textit{over following a plan} \\
\parencite{Scrum}.
\end{center}
%"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", "Working software over comprehensive documentation", "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation" and "Responding to change over following a plan" from the Agile Manifesto\parencite{Scrum}. 

These principles of Scrum and Agile manifesto are not so rigid as the principles of the Waterfall method. Some may say that Scrum is the opposite of the Waterfall method \parencite{cocco2011simulating}. 

Scrum have three main roles, the Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the members of the development team. The Product owner in collaboration with the Scrum Master decides which work to be prioritized in the backlog. The backlog represents the tasks to be done in order to complete the project. The Scrum Master acts like a team leader and helps the development team and the organization to take best advantages of Scrum. The development team works on tasks specific for the sprint there in \parencite{Scrum}.

Sprint is a time-boxed interval over a given time. The Scrum framework suggests duration of sprints to be from one to four weeks. Before each sprint, a sprint planning meeting is conducted with all the team members attending.  A Sprint planning meeting is held so the team can discuss tasks from the backlog and come to an agreement of which tasks to be put in the minimal backlog \parencite{Scrum}.

In each sprint a minimal backlog is created so the developer knows which tasks to work on in the current sprint. The Product Owner and the team members discuss and decide which tasks from the backlog to be added to the minimal backlog. After the minimal backlog is complete, the Product Owner and the team members discuss each task in order to get a better and shared understanding of what is required to complete the tasks \parencite{Scrum}. 

One of the main principles in Scrum is that it requires that at least one new feature is ready for release after each sprint. The feature should be a visible part of the product in order to get feedback from end-users. So all the tasks in the minimal backlog combined should be a visible part of the product \parencite{Scrum}.


\section {Lean}
\label{sec:Lean}
"Lean is all about getting the right things to the right place at the right time the first time while minimizing waste and being open to change" \parencite{741480}.
The Lean approach was introduced around 1948 in manufacturing in Japan.  In 1975, Toyota was able to create almost 50 more production units per employee than in 1948 due to the Lean approach \parencite{manning}. Lean strives to maximize the value produced by an organization and delivered to costumer. This is done by finding and eliminate waste, controlling variability and maximizing the flow of delivered software all within the culture of continuous improvements \parencite{DavidAnderson}. In 2003 Mary and Tom Poppendieck first introduced Lean thinking to software development. Poppendieck published the book "Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit" \parencite{Lean:2003}. In the book, Poppendieck stated that an important tool to manage work flow is the concept of pull-systems, which means tasks are put in production only when a costumer asks for it \parencite{Lean:2009}.
The pull based method Kanban has in recent years been introduced more and more to software development, and is becoming one of the keys to Lean practice in software development \parencite{DavidAnderson}. In Lean there are eight fundamental principles \parencite{poppendieck2003lean}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Start Early:}  Don't wait for details. As soon as enough information is gathered start the development activity. Get everyone involved in figuring out the details. Don't build any walls between people, make people collaborate and start a two-way communication as soon possible. This will start the learning cycle as well.

\item \textbf{Learn Constantly:} Start with a breadth-first approach, explore multiple options. The system is expected to change, so focus on creating simplicity code and robustness so the system is easy to change

\item \textbf{Delay Commitment:} 
In order to delay commitment, automated testing and refactoring are essential for keeping code changeable. 

\item \textbf{Deliver Fast:}
Deliver fast mark of excellent operational capability. The whole idea of \textbf{delaying commitment} is to make every decision as late as possible when one have the most knowledge.
\item \textbf{Eliminate Waste:}
The only thing worth doing is deliver value to the costumer, anything else is waste.  Discover waste and eliminate it is the first key of Lean.  Lean suggests using a value stream map for removing waste. A Value Stream Map (VSM) is a map over the whole company chain. VSM helps visualize where waste is located within the company.
\item \textbf{Empower the team:} When one is going to deliver fast, there is no room for central control. The work environment should be structured so work and workers are self-directing.

\item \textbf{Build Integrity In:} Lean software is build with integrity. That's why one of the principles in Lean suggests that tests are integrated into software development just as any code, so it becomes a part of the delivered product. 

\item \textbf{Avoid Sub-optimization:} In software development it's normal to break down a complex problem into small parts of the problem in order to minimize the complexity.  If some of the parts are sub-optimized, bottlenecks can occur. For example, if ten developers are hired to work on tasks, but only three testers are hired. The development process is sub-optimized since the developers will likely produce more than the tester can test and that could cause bottleneck.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Kanban}
\label{sec:Kan}
\iffalse
Shinkle defined novice and more experience kanban-users with a descriptive analogy \parencite{Shinkle}:
''Think about a typical person wanting to bake a cake. They go to the store, purchase a boxed cake mix, and follow the directions as described on the back of the box. They have little to no knowledge about how to alter the recipe nor do they have a desire to do so. Their goal is simply to bake a cake.''

''An advanced beginner understands how to apply some context to the instructions or rules on the back of the box. They can make minor adjustments for things like altitude, pan size, oven conditions, etc. They are still following the basic recipe, but can make minor adjustments likely based on previous experiences." According to Shinkle, principles like WIP limit will be adopted when the user has some experience with Kanban. 
\fi


Toyota production system introduced Kanban as a scheduling system for Lean and just-in-time (JIT) production during late 1940's and in the early 1950's in order to catch up with the American car industry. The Kanban method combined with the Lean approach was a success for Toyota. The success was noticed by the software development industry among others \parencite{Conboy}, \parencite{ono1988toyota}. In the recent years, the software industry has seen an increasing amount of project that applies Kanban and Lean principles \parencite{DavidAnderson}, and this is one of the reasons why this thesis will focus on Kanban, more specific, one of its key principles WIP limits.

''One can define Kanban software process as a WIP limited pull system visualized by the Kanban board''  \parencite{DavidAnderson}.
One of the most important people in Kanban software development, David Anderson  also referred to as ''father of Kanban in the software development industry''  \parencite{InfoQ:2013:May:Online} and author of the book "Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business" stated ''If you think that there was Capability Maturity Model Integration, there was Rational Unified Process, there was Extreme Programming and there was Scrum, Kanban is the next thing in that succession.''   \parencite{InfoQ} .

In software development, Kanban splits the major problem into many small pieces of problems. When the small pieces are defined by the team, the problems are put up on the Kanban board to visualize the problems, track what others are working on and see potential bottlenecks during development. Shinkle stated that when people start to understand Kanban, they easily discover where the bottlenecks are \parencite{Shinkle}. In short, Kanban systems focus on \parencite{DavidAnderson}:

\begin{itemize}
\item continuous flow of work,
\item	no fixed iterations or sprints,
\item work is delivered when it's done,
\item teams only work on few tasks at the time specified by the WIP limit and
\item make constant flow of released tasks.
\end{itemize}


Contrary to Scrum, Kanban do not use the principles of sprints or estimations. In Kanban the tasks do not need to be estimated or finished within a certain time. In the article "Simulation of software maintenance process, with and without a work-in-process limit" \parencite{SMR:SMR1599} the authors found out that if they let the developers work with small tasks and are not interrupted, they will be more effective. They also found out that Scrum was too rigid for the development team because when the team had to estimate tasks, they felt interrupted.  The estimation and sprint meetings worked counterproductive in their case. The authors made the developers change to Lean-Kanban.  The change implied the removal of sprints and estimation. After removing sprints and estimation the teams increased the ability to perform work, lower the lead time and meet the production dates \parencite{SMR:SMR1599}.

In the article "Quantifying the Effect of Using Kanban versus Scrum:" the company also felt that the Scrum approach was too rigid. The article also reported positive results when the team changed to Kanban.  The company almost halved its lead time, reduced the number of weighted bugs by 10 percent, and improved productivity \parencite{Dag}. Other articles also state that Scrum maybe too rigid and that's Kanbans advantages over Scrum \parencite{beedle1999scrum} \parencite{brekkanintroducing} .  

\subsection {Kanban Board}
''The Kanban board makes it clear to all the team members the exact status of progress, blockages, bottlenecks and they also signal possible future issues to prepare for''\parencite{Joyce}.  The Kanban board is one of many tools in Kanban. It's used to control WIP, increase the information flow with visualization \parencite{SMR:SMR1599}. A Kanban board is illustrated in figure \ref{kanban_board}. Each column in figure has \ref{kanban_board} an intuitive name in order to describe itself so the developers easily can track where each task is. 

The columns are named "Backlog", "In progress" and "Done".  Each column can have a WIP limit to specify how many items in progress there are allowed in the column \parencite{Joyce}. In figure \ref{kanban_board} the WIP limit is stated under the column name. The backlog column has a WIP limit of 4, In progress has 5 and Done doesn't need a WIP limit. 

The yellow stickers represent the tasks. Some follow the path to mark stickers with different colors representing the severities or by marking if its a feature or a bug. In the article "Kanban Implementation in a Telecom Product Maintenance" for instance, the stickers has three different colors, green, yellow and red depending on how close to overdue the tasks are. If the sticker is red, the task is already overdue, if the tasks are soon-to-overdue its marked with yellow stickers \parencite{6068363}. In another project, they used yellow sticky notes for scenarios, blue for bugs, pink for issues \parencite{Shinkle}.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Picture/kanban_board.jpg}
\caption{Example of a Kanban board}
\label{kanban_board}
\end{figure}

\subsection{WIP limit}
\label{WIPsec}
''WIP limits seem to be the worst understood part of the Kanban system. When used properly, it exposes bottlenecks and reduces lead time for individual work items. Used improperly, it can starve developers for work or result in too many people working on the same work items.'' \parencite{Shinkle}

WIP limit is one of the core principles in Kanban \parencite{6068363}. WIP limit helps to reduce overhead by limit task-switching for each developer and make constant flow of tasks throughout the development \parencite{DavidAnderson}. One way to explain WIP and the asserted impact of WIP limit is to use cars and roads as analogy. All roads have a maximum capacity of cars. When this limit is reached, traffic jam occurs and the throughput of cars decreases and lead time increases. The same can be said about software development teams. A software team has a maximum number of tasks they can perform, if the team is pushed over the maximum limit, the throughput of tasks may decreases and lead time may increases.

When first implementing Kanban, Shinkle explains that the users often don't care about WIP or setting a WIP limit, but rather the visibility of Kanban through the Kanban board. When users gain more experience with Kanban, they start to attempt the principles of WIP limit \parencite{Shinkle}. Srinivasan, Ebbing and Swearing said that setting the WIP limit is not easy. They suggest that the WIP limit is set, and then observe throughput, and adjust after that \parencite{Mandyam}. In the book "Kanban and Scrum - making the most of both" suggests Kniberg that you start by limiting WIP, then experiment with it \parencite{Kniberg}. The article "Lean Software Management" \parencite{Kniberg} and the "Impact of Kanban on Software Project Work" \parencite{Ikonen} both suggest that WIP should be minimized as well. The conclusion of present study is to keep the WIP limit low and experiment by slowly increase the WIP limit until the throughput decreased and lead time increased, then you know that the previous WIP limit was the perfect one.

The Section \ref{sub:wip:vs:wip} shows a summary of the the articles by Giulio Concas, Hongyu Zhang \parencite{SMR:SMR1599}  and David Anderson, Giulio Concas, Maria Ilaria Lunesu, and Michele Marchesi \parencite{DavidAnderson}. The articles researched the difference between limit WIP and unlimited WIP. Section \ref{sub:sub:benefits} shows the importance of limit WIP, stated by various researches. 

On "how to determine WIP limit", one article was found. If one implements Kanban with sprints or uses Scrum, \L ukasz proposes to use the effectiveness metric to help determine the WIP limit.The effectiveness metric shown in formula \ref{WIPEQ}, should be applied after end sprint according to \L ukasz. After each sprint, one can apply the effectiveness metric and the result could be used as a guideline for WIP limit for the next sprint. The effectiveness metric takes the number of bugs found \textit{(ai)} and the number of bugs found by external people (e.g. lawyers, accountants, coaches, consultants, translators, internal and external service providers etc.) \textit{(ei)}, and minus \textit{ai} and \textit{ei}, then divide the result by \textit{ai} and multiply it by 100\%  as shown in formula \ref{WIPEQ} \parencite{Sienkiewicz}

\begin{equation} \label{WIPEQ}
Ei=\frac{(ai-ei)}{ai}*100\%
\end{equation}

\subsubsection {Limit WIP vs. Unlimited WIP}
\label{sub:wip:vs:wip}
In an article cite by Giulio Concas and Hongyu Zhang, they simulated two different software maintenance processes. The first process were based on 4 years of experience with Microsoft maintenance team. The second process were from a Chinese software firm.  The simulation executed 10 runs and one of the results were  the average of closed tasks was 4145 when the WIP was limited and 3853 when the limit was not limited (about 7\% less). The paper concludes their finds; developers are more focused on fixing few issues, because the number of issues they can work on is limited. The developers are more likely to continue on the issue from the day before, rather than starting on another issue. This reduces overhead, Because when developers start on a new issue, they need time to familiarize themselves with the code and the issue. That could create unnecessary overhead if some developer already has done it, but that developer is now working on another issue. 

The study also showed that limit WIP can improve throughput and work efficiency, because WIP-limits prevents task switching. In the article, the authors also simulated a software process, the process was originally without WIP - limits, with WIP-limits. The original process was outperformed by the simulated process with WIP-limits. \parencite{SMR:SMR1599}.

The case by David Anderson et al. \parencite{DavidAnderson} did a simulation of lean-kanban approach with the impact of WIP limit vs. no WIP limit on developers with skills in different activities. The four skill activities from the article were design, development, testing and deployment. 

The article did four different simulations.  A simulation with WIP limits and seven developers with skill in two of the four activities. A simulation with no WIP limit and seven developers with skilled in two of the four activities. A simulation with WIP limits and seven developers with skill in all of the activities. A simulation with no WIP limits and seven developers with skill in two of the four activities.

The paper concluded that the last two is unlikely in the real world, because there is rarely a whole team with developers skilled in all activities. 
When the developers had skill in two out of four activities, the WIP limit simulation used 100 days, but the non WIP limit simulation used 120 days. The simulation with WIP limit showed an almost constant flow of features that completed, while in the same simulation with no WIP limit, the flow of features was much more irregular \parencite{DavidAnderson}.

\subsubsection{Benefits with setting WIP limit}
\label{sub:sub:benefits}
This subsection contains excerpt from papers from various authors that have done study on WIP limit. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lowering the WIP limit will help people avoid task switching. When one is task switching it's hard to be able to fully concentrate. \parencite{Ikonen}.
\item There's stated when using short-cycle times and Kanban board to limit WIP, the software development team's learning is increased \parencite{Joyce}:
\item WIP - limit increases productivity \parencite{Joyce}.
\item WIP - limit reduce cycle time \parencite{Ola}
\item When WIP was too high, lead times grew and as a result so did the bugs and rework \parencite{Shinkle}.
\item  WIP-limits are important to reduce lead times \parencite{KanbanWay} 
\end{enumerate}

Both the studies on WIP limit vs. o limit, the articles and research shows the importance of WIP limit. If  \L ukasz's effectiveness metric is regarded , there is no clear rule on how to determine WIP limit even though WIP is supposed to be a crucial principle in order to take full advantage of Kanban.

\section {Lead time}
\label{sec:in:lt}
''Lead time is the total elapsed time from when a customer requests software to when the finished software is released to the customer'' \parencite{Joyce}. Lead time is measured to track how quickly software is delivered to customers \parencite{Joyce}. Lead time could be an essential ingredient when you look for the optimal WIP, if there is one.  Often in a project, lead time is split into pieces, so every task has its own lead time. This gives the development teams the advantages to experiment with different WIPs in order to see the different lead times and then measure which WIP that suits this project the best. 

According to the paper "Quantifying the effect of Using Kanban versus Scrum" \parencite{Dag} the citation by Middleton and Joyce above is close to definition of what lead time is. They define lead time as the amount of time that passed from the moment that the development team receives a request to the moment that it completes the work item. The reason why the paper disapproves the definition by Middleton and Joyce is because: "The amount of time a work item remains in the backlog queue before it's put on the board is a function of priority, not whether the company uses Scrum, Kanban or other development methods. Furthermore, companies that develop and sell products to many customers might propose new features themselves and put them on the backlog before any customers request them. Second, given a policy of two or three releases a year, the result of a work item isn't delivered to the customer immediately after it's finished'' \parencite{Dag}.



\section{Just-In-Time}
"Just-In-Time is based on delivering only the necessary products, to the necessary time and the necessary quantity" \parencite{JIT}.
Just-In-Time (JIT) was introduced in the 1970s by Toyota in combination with Lean \parencite{javadian2013just}.  JIT has been introduced to increase productivity through waste reduction and increasing the value added in the production processes. To explain the JIT principle, Mary and Tom Poppendieck use the picture shown in Figure \ref{JITE}  \parencite{JIT} \parencite{Lean:2006}. The stream reflects the inventory.  Under the stream, there are rocks located in different sizes. The rocks illustrates waste and problems that can occur.  If the stream level is lowered, the rocks are more visualized. At this point you have to clear out rocks (remove waste and problems) in order to make the boat continue it's journey, or it will crash into the rocks. After the rocks are cleaned out, one can lower the stream level again and continue the procedure until there are only pebbles left. Then the boat can float without problems.

If one lower the stream (inventory), problems and waste will become visible (visualized by rocks). Lean wants to lower inventory in order to make problems and waste occur, because when problems and waste occurs, you are able to fix the problems and remove the waste. Fixing the problem and removing the waste has several benefits such as, your process could be optimized and you are one step closer to have zero problems and zero waste.  \parencite{JIT} \parencite{Lean:2006}.

In Software development the JIT principle means one should not deliver anything before its demanded. For example, if a development team adds two new features to a product without the stakeholders asking for it. The team spends day on these features, and it turns out stakeholders don't want the features. Then the development team has produced the number of team members persons days of waste.

\section{Throughput}
''The output of a production process (machine, workstation, line plant) per unit time (e.g., parts per hour) is defined as the systems throughput or sometimes throughput rate'' \parencite{Adams}.
The main concept of throughput is to measure how productive teams, people or companies are. Throughput is measured in number of finished delivered tasks or units per hour, day, week, month, quarter or year. A key factor in successfully measuring throughput in software development is to specify a standard size for each task. If the standard is not specified there is little use in throughput measurements.  \parencite{Throughput}. To illustrate throughput with different task sizes an example is provided:  

Lets say Team x had a throughput of eighteen tasks after the first quarter, twenty after the second, fifteen after the third and twelve after the last quarter. Team x used Scrum the first two quarters and Kanban the last two as illustrated in table \ref{tt}. It will look like team x benefits most from Scrum. But if the task during the Kanban time was twice the size of Scrum, Kanban would suite team x the best. So, to get valid result from throughput measurements, the size of tasks has to be agreed upon by the teams or company.
\begin{table}[ht]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    Quarter & Throughput & Method\\ \hline
    1 & 18 & Scrum\\ \hline
    2 & 20 & Scrum \\ \hline
    3 & 15 & Kanban\\ \hline
    4 & 12 & Kanban\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\caption{Throughput}
\label{tt} %% throughput table
\end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Code churn}
\label{sec:Churn}
"Churn is defined as the sum of the number of lines added, deleted, and modified in the source code" \parencite{Dag}.
Churn is a measure that is not as familiar as lead time, throughput or WIP in the software industry. Churn is a term used as surrogates for effort in software engineering. Many studies in software engineering use code churn or revisions as surrogate measure of effort \parencite{yamashita2012quantifying}. Emam stated that "analysts should be discouraged from using surrogate measures, such as code churn, unless there is evidence that they are indeed good surrogates" \parencite{el2000methodology}. The study by Sj\o berg et al. showed that churn could be used as a surrogate for tasks size \parencite{yamashita2012quantifying}. 


\section{Software Innovation}
\label{sec:SI}
Software Innovation is a Scandinavian software company. SI develops and delivers Enterprise Content Management applications that helps organizations improve and increase efficiency in document management, case handling and technical document control. SI builds products around the Microsoft Sharepoint platform. \parencite{Dag}, \parencite{SI}.

SI has approximately 300 employees in Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Bangalore \parencite{SI}. From 2001 to 2006, SI used the Waterfall process. In 2007, SI changed to Scrum, and in 2010, SI went from Scrum to Kanban \parencite{Dag}.

\subsection{Teams}
Table \ref{table:teams} shows the size of the ten teams vs. quarter. The team size is used as a variable to compute the result for thesis. Team seven, shown in Table \ref{Team:7} contribute data from 2010 to 2012. After 2012, team seven was shut down.

\chapter{Research Methods}
\label{chap:RM}
In this chapter the research methods used in this thesis will be introduced and the reason why the data set from Software Innovation was chosen. Section \ref{sec:CS} gives a brief introduction to the research method "Case Study".  Section \ref{sec:coc} is about the choice of case and complementary information about Software Innovation. 


\section{Case study}
\label{sec:CS}
To answer the research questions, a case study was conducted.  A case study is used to explore causation in order to find underlying principles \parencite{0078285763}\parencite{9781412960991}.  But which methods one can use in a case study or how the case study is conducted is ambiguous.  It might be that the case study is qualitative or quantitate.  A case study might utilize a particular type of evidence (for example ethnographic, participant observation or field research).  Jennifer Platt stated: "Much case study theorizing has been conceptually confused because too many different themes have been packed into the idea "case study" \parencite{0521676568}.  John Gerring stated: "A case study may be understood as the intensive study of a single case where the purpose of that study is -- at least in part to shed light on a larger class of cases  \parencite{0521676568}. As one can see, there is no clear rule of how to conduct a case study or what it is. 


%John also stated: "Case connotes a spatially delimited phenomenon (a unit) observed at a single point in time or over a period of time"\parencite{0521676568}. 
In this thesis, the case study is used to explore WIP limit's effect in software development. The purpose is to shed light on WIP limit in software development and if it matters.

\section{Choice of case}
\label{sec:coc}
The data set from SI contains information about each task SI has worked on from 2008 to 2013. The data set is represented in an excel document. An excerpt of some of the columns in the document is shown in table \ref{dataset}. Although the data set contains items from 2008-2013, data from year 2008, 2009 and the two first quarters of 2010 will be excluded. The dates will be excluded partially because the transition between processes and it was inaccurate measurements when SI first started with TFS.

The reason SI and the data set from SI is analyzed in this thesis is because the article "Quantifying the Effect of Using Kanban versus Scrum" \parencite{Dag} used the same data set. Because Dag is the supervisor of this thesis and he had access to the data set, it was convenient to use the data set.

Both the variable churn and throughput is split up in two sub variables with suffix of "Feature" and "Bug". The variable with suffix of {feature} means tasks labeled with type {feature} are the only one that counted. The same goes for variables with suffix {bug}. These variables are referred to as sub variables in this thesis.  The {Bugs finished, quarter} variable represents how many tasks labeled bug that are finished within the same quarter as it was created.  The {Avg days backlog, bug} variable represent the average number of days bugs were in backlog before it was pulled out. %These two variables are used as an indicator of the workload together with churn.   




\subsection{Software Innovation's development process}
From 2001 to 2006 SI used the Waterfall process with a life cycle of:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item Design
\item Implementation 
\item Testing
\item Deployment for each new release
\end{enumerate} 
\parencite{Dag}. 

In 2007, SI examined their development process, which resulted in a decision to change to Scrum. Scrum was implemented with the standard elements of Scrum:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item Cross functional teams
\item Sprint planning meetings 
\item Estimation of work items using planning poker
\item Daily standup meetings
\item Sprints
\end{itemize}
\parencite{Dag}. 

SI implemented three weeks sprint, after each sprint a fully tested shippable system was ready. In 2010, SI went from Scrum to Kanban. SI felt that Scrum was too rigid and didn't fit their purpose, they also feared that inaccurate estimation and time boxing gave them longer lead time. SI also saw Scrum planning meetings as waste which reduced productivity and quality \parencite{Dag}. 

SI decided to implement Kanban in the following manner. When a work item is pulled from the backlog, SI tries to make the item flow through all the stages until it's ready for release. This procedure happens as quickly as possible. In order for an item to be ready for release, it has to be at a satisfactory quality level, which is defined by SI. SI also implemented WIP limits. If the WIP limit is reached, no new tasks are started until another task is finished which is based on the principle of just-in-time \parencite{Dag}.

\section{Correlation}
The correlation coefficient between two variables is used to reflect the linear relationship between these variables. The most common used is Pearson correlation.  The range of the correlation is [-1, +1], where +1 represents a perfect positive relationship and -1 represents a perfect negative relationship \parencite{6683402}. In this thesis I want to look at the linear relationship between two variables, so I have chosen to use Pearson correlation.

\chapter{Data collected and calculations}
\label{ch:DCC}
This chapter introduces how the algorithms of the software program works as well as a brief introduction to SPSS. The first section gives a short introduction to the statistical analyze program SPSS (Section \ref{sec:SPSS}). The next section, Section \ref{WPD} introduces the algorithm of how the program measures WIP for each day. The subsection \ref{sec:Example} provides a comprehensive example of how the program measures WIP per day. The consecutively sections reveal the algorithms of how the program measures  throughput (Section \ref{sec:TP}),  churn (Section \ref{sec:churn}),  lead time (Section \ref{sec:LT}), sub variables (Section \ref{sec:bug}), number of bugs finished per quarter (Section  \ref{sub:sec:bfq}) and average days for bugs in the backlog (Section \ref{sub:sec:adbb}). 

Table \ref{tab:measurementDone} shows how quarters, dates and days are represented in this thesis. 

\begin{table}[!ht]

\section{SPSS}
\label{sec:SPSS}
"IBM\circledR  SPSS\circledR Statistics is a comprehensive system for analyzing data. SPSS Statistics can take data from almost any type of a file and use them to generate tabulated reports, charts and plots of distributions and trends, descriptive statistics, and complex statistical analyses." \parencite{IBM}. After the software program has finished the measurements of the data, SPSS will be used to analyze the derived data with help of two statistics method: correlation and case summaries.

\subsection{Step 1: Gather all unique dates into a Arraylist}
\label{sub:stepOne}
The first step of this WIP algorithm is to create a WIP object with the attributes in Table \ref{tab:object}.  The values that are assigned to the object are gathered from the data set file, which is shown in Listing \ref{lst:Arraylist} . After the values are assigned, the program puts the WIP object into the right Arraylist\footnote{Arraylist is a resizable array implementation of a list. The Arraylist class provides function for manipulating the size of the array, check the size of the list and convert the list to an array  \parencite{Arraylist}.} based on the team variable as shown in listing \ref{lst:addWIP}. 
\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
\hline
\bf{Type} & \bf{Variable name} \\ \hline
Date & start \\ \hline
Date & end\\ \hline
String & team\\ \hline
String & processType\\ \hline

\end{tabular}

			TeamThree.add(w)			
/* And so on for the rest if the seven teams */
 \end{lstlisting}
 
 \newpage
\subsection{Step 2: Gather the remaining dates}
 \label{sub:stepTwo}
There are some dates missing as shown in Table \ref{wt:2}. For example, the date 2010-10-08 is missing. In order to generate WIP for each day, the program has to create the dates that are not in the set. In order to create the remaining dates, the program takes the first date and the last date from each of the teams' Arraylist, this is shown in Subsection (\ref{sub:stepOne}) as shown in line one and two of Listing \ref{lst:remaining}. Then the program checks if all the dates between the first date and the last date are in the team's Arraylist. Each of the Arraylists are sorted by date. If the dates are not in the Arraylist, the program will generate the date and put it into the Arraylist, as show at the method addToArraylist (lines 10-13).
In order to keep the pseudocode simple, the generateWIP method stated in line twelve was omitted. The generateWIP method creates a new WIP object and returns it.



\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Gather the remaining dates.},label={lst:remaining}]
WIP first = Arraylist.get(0)//points to the first WIP object in the Arraylist 
WIP last = Arraylist.get(Arraylist.size()-1)//points to the last WIP object in the Arraylist 
Next_date //points to the next date
Next_date = first.getDate() // Next_date assigned before iteration
while Next_date NOT EQUALS last.getDate()
	New_date = Next_Date + 1 //Compute the next date
	AddToArraylist(New_date, first.getTeam())
	Next_date = New_date

void addToArraylist(Date d, String team)
	if d NOT CONTAINS IN Arraylist
		WIP = generateWIP(d, team)
		Arraylist.add(WIP) 
 \end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Step 3 Measure WIP}
\vspace{-2.0em}
The Arraylists from section \ref{sub:stepOne}  and \ref{sub:stepTwo} now contains a WIP object for each date for each team. In this step, the program will loop through each of the teams Arraylists. During the iteration each WIP object is extracted from the Arraylist and the WIP is measured. The two methods stated in line 10 and 17 respectively gather the current WIP (method in line 10) and finds how many tasks are finished (method in line 18) and returns the result. The result is used in line 6 to compute the current WIP. The conditional statement on line 4 assures only one instance of each date is measured. 
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth} 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={WIP measurement},label={lst:measure}]
void measureWIP()
	lastWIP =  0
	for WIP Object IN Arraylist	
		if(DateNotMeasured(WIP.getStartDate()) == true)
			WIP_for_this_date = get_current_WIP(WIP.getStartDate())  
			WIP_measured = WIP_for_this_date - Nr_of_finishedDates(WIP.getStartDate) + lastWIP
			WIP.setWIP(WIP_measured)
			lastWIP = WIP_measured 

int get_current_WIP(Date date)
	current_WIP = 0
	for WIP in  Arraylist
		if date EQUALS WIP.getStartDate()
			Nr_of_dates_to_decrement++
return current_WIP
			 	
int Nr_of_finished_dates(Date date)
	Nr_of_dates_to_decrement = 0
	for WIP in Arraylist
		if date AFTER WIP.getEndDate() DO
			if date not picked
				Nr_of_dates_to_decrement++
				dateIsPicked(WIP)				
return Nr_of_dates_to_decrement 
 \end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}

\subsection{Example}
\label{sec:Example}
This section will provide a comprehensive example of how the WIP algorithm works.  
Figure \ref{wip_timeline}  shows task ids on the y-axis and dates on the x-axis. The green line indicates the duration of the task. The figure helps  visualize how many WIPs there are in progress for a given date. For example on the date 2010-10-12, tasks 3, 5 and 6 are in progress, which means the WIP is 3 for 2010-10-12. The dates from Table \ref{wt:2}  will be used to illustrate how the algorithm measures WIP.

    \end{tabular}
\caption{Showing Task ID, Date From and Date to}
\label{wt:2} %%  wip table 2\
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Step 1}
The program will first read in line 1 of table \ref{wt:2}.  Line 1 is the one with task id one.  The program creates the WIP-object line 1 and it will look like the Listing \ref{lst:WIPOBJ}.  The program will follow the exact same procedure until all the dates are read. 

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth} 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Creating WIP-object},label={lst:WIPOBJ}]
WIP = new WIP()
WIP.start = 2010-10-07
WIP.end = 2010-10-08
WIP.team = "Team One"
WIP.processType = "Kanban"
WIP.WIP = 1
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}

 \subsubsection{Step 2}
\label{sub:sub:st}
Now that the whole set has been read and saved, the next thing to do is to create the remaining dates. The Arraylist contains all the dates from Table \ref{wt:2}.  The program will now extract the first and the last date from the Arraylist. Before this step, the objects in the Arraylist are sorted by date. The first date is 2010-10-07 and the last date is 2010-10-13.  The program will check if the date after 2010-10-07 contains in the set, which it does not. The program then generates a WIP object for the date 2010-10-08 and adds it to the Arraylist as shown in Listing \ref{lst:WIPCREATE}. After the date is created, the program will see if the date 2008-10-09 exits and will do so for all dates up to the date 2010-10-13.

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth} 
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Creating WIP-object},label={lst:WIPCREATE}]
void createNewWIP(Date d, String team) 
	WIP.start = d
	WIP.end = d
	WIP.team = team
	WIP.processType = "Unknown"
	WIP.WIP = 0
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{minipage}


\subsubsection{Step 3}
The Arraylist now contains the dates from 2010-10-08 to 2010-10-13. The next and last step is to measure WIP for each date.  The program will now loop through the Arraylists. The first date is 2010-10-07.  The get\_current\_wip method from line nine in Listing \ref{lst:measure} will be called with the date 2010-10-07 as parameter.  The method will return two, because both tasks one and two were started at 2010-10-07 as shown by Figure \ref{wip_timeline}. The next thing to do is to find out how many tasks to decrement the current WIP with.  The method Nr\_of\_finished\_dates in line seventeen is called with the date 2010-10-07. As shown by the Table \ref{wt:2} and Figure \ref{wip_timeline} there was no task finished at the date 2010-10-07, so the method returns 0. The program then updates the WIP objects' counter to be two and saves the WIP value in the lastWIP variable. The next date is 2010-10-08, which the program made in Subsection \ref{sub:sub:st}. There is no task started at 2010-10-08, but task one is finished at the date. So the Nr\_of\_finished\_dates returns one and flags the current date as shown in Listing \ref{lst:measure} by the line 23. The result of WIP\_measure in line five is 1 ($0-1+2=1$). WIP at date 2010-10-08 is one, as shown by figure \ref{wip_timeline}. The program will continue this procedure until all the dates are measured.  The reason why the date is flagged is to be sure that each date is only evaluated ones.
\iffalse
\subsubsection{First step}
\label{subsubsec:ft}
The program will first do a look-up on the date 2008-10-07 referred with task ID one and two in table \ref{wt:2} and measure the current WIP counter, which is two, because its two tasks in progress on this date. After this the program will put the date and the current WIP into a Arraylist. 
Now the algorithm will see if any task was done in the last period, since task one and two is the two first tasks to be measured in this example, there's no task finished in the period and there's no current WIP from other tasks, so the current WIP at 2008-10-07 is two illustrated by figure \ref{wip_timeline}. 
\subsubsection{Second step}
The program will do a look-up on the date 2008-10-09 referred with task ID three, four and five in table \ref{wt:2}  and measure the current WIP for this date, which is three. Then, the program will put the date and the current WIP into a Arraylist.
Next, the program will see that two tasks were done in the period of 2008-10-07 to 2008-10-09. So the program will measure that three new tasks were started at 2008-10-09, two where finished and the WIP from last date measure where two, so the calculation of WIP at 2008-10-09 is 3-2+2, which gives a WIP of three on 2008-10-09 illustrated by figure \ref{wip_timeline}. 

\subsubsection{Third step}
The program will do a look-up on the date 2008-10-10 referred with task ID six and seven in table \ref{wt:2}  and measure the current WIP for this date, which is two. Next the program will put the date and the current WIP into a Arraylist.
Last the program will see that no task where done in the period 2008-10-09 to 2008-10-10 and the currently WIP is three, so this gives a new WIP of 5 illustrated by figure \ref{wip_timeline}. 

\subsubsection{Fourth step}
The program will do a look-up on the date 2008-10-13 referred with task ID eight and nine in table \ref{wt:2}  and measure the current WIP for this date, which is two. Then the program will put the date and the current WIP into a Arraylist. 
Next the program will look at the period between 2008-10-10 and 2008-10-13, and see that task four and seven was done in this period. The WIP at 2008-10-13 will be $2-2+5 = 5$ as illustrated by figure \ref{wip_timeline}. 
As illustrated by the example, WIPs are not decrement until the finished date is passed, even though the task is done on the date, it's also worked on the same date, therefore the WIP is decrement after each date is passed.

 \section{Rest of the variables}
 \label{sec:rotv}
To compute the remaining variables a new algorithm is required.  The first part of the algorithm for the remaining variables is equal. First the program reads in the data set from SI. For each of the lines in the data set, the program creates an object and saves the valuable information from the data set in the object. Then each object is saved in a data structure based on team association as showed in Listing \ref{addObj}.  After all the lines has been read and all objects has been put in the right data structure the algorithms differs. \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Pseudocode example of how throughput objects are added, label=addObj]
void addBug(Bug b)
	if b.team EQUALS "TeamOne"
		if dateExists(b.date, TeamOne) EQUALS false
			// if date don't exists, then add the bug
			TeamOne.add(b)
			
	if b.team EQUALS "TeamTwo"
		if dateExists(b.date, TeamTwo) EQUALS false
			// if date don't exists, then add the bug
			TeamTwo.add(b)
			
	if b.team EQUALS "TeamThree"
		if dateExists(b.date, TeamThree) EQUALS false 
			// if date don't exists, then add the bug
			TeamThree.add(b)
			
	if b.team EQUALS "TeamFour"
		if dateExists(b.date, TeamFour) EQUALS false
			// if date don't exists, then add the bug
			TeamFour.add(b)
			
			/* And so on for the rest of the teams */
		
	
 \end{lstlisting}
 
% void dateExists(Date d, Arraylist list)
%	for Bug b in list
%		if b.date EQUALS d
%			b.counter++
%	
%return false The method in line 24 assurance that only on object of each date is in the data structure
 
\subsection{Throughput}
 \label{sec:TP}
When the steps described in Section \ref{sec:rotv} are finished, the program takes the teams data structures and compute throughput. To compute throughput, a counter representing the throughput for each date is created. The method dateExists in listing \ref{throughputCode} does the actual computation. The method starts of with a test. If the date of the throughput object is in the data structure, the corresponding counter is incremented.  If the date is not in the data structure, the new throughput object is added to the data structure. 
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Pseudocode example of how throughput is measured, label=throughputCode]
void dateExists(Throughput tp, Arraylist list)
	for Throughput t in list
		if t.date EQUALS tp.date
			t.counter++
			return
			
	structure.add(tp);
\end{lstlisting}
 \end{minipage}


\subsection{Churn}
\label{sec:churn}
As stated in Section \ref{sec:Churn} in order to take churn into account one has to know its good surrogates. SI has gathered churn with help of Microsoft's Team Foundation Server (TFS) \parencite{Dag}. The TFS system automatically records data such as churn and lead time. Based on TFS one can know that churn for SI is a good surrogate.

To measure churn the data set from SI contains three columns ("Lines added, "Lines modified" and "Lines deleted") shown in Table \ref{table:churn}. These three variables are summed together and saved in a  variable called "churn" when the data set is read.  For example; for task id one, the churn is 2028 ($352+307+1369 = 2028$). Some tasks has zero churn, for example task with id six, these tasks don't need code in order to be finished such tasks need technical support to be finished. The churn algorithm is shown in listing \ref{churnCode}

\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
\bf{Task id} & \bf{Lines added} & \bf{Lines modified}  & \bf{Lines deleted} \\ \hline

2&314 & 31 & 15 \\ \hline
3&314&31 & 15\\ \hline
4&62&327&153 \\ \hline

	for Churn ch in list
		if ch.date EQUALS c.date
			ch.churn += c.churn
			return
	structure.add(c);
\end{lstlisting}
 \end{minipage}
 


\subsection{Lead time}
\label{sec:LT}
The program does not need to analyze  the lead time for each task. The lead time for each task is recorded by TFS. The lead time is represented in the data set by a column as shown in Table \ref{table:LT}. The program will gather all the tasks that are started on the same date and belongs to the same team and add up their lead time together as showed in code Listing \ref{LTcode}.   
\begin{table}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
\hline
	\bf{ID} & \bf{Type} & \bf{Lead time} \\ \hline
	84096 &  Feature  & 1 \\ \hline
	84118 &  Bug  & 25 \\ \hline
	84096 &  Feature  & 7 \\ \hline
	84118 &  Bug  & 13 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

		if lead_time.date EQUALS t.date
			lead_time.lead time+= t.lead time
			return
			
	structure.add(t)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\subsection{Lead time and churn}
As stated in the article "Quantifying the Effect of Using Kanban versus Scrum" \parencite{Dag} to prevent outliers from having a large effect on the results, the top and lowest ten percent of lead time and churn are removed from the data set.
Churn is removed because a module or a feature, which consists of hundreds or thousands of lines of code could be removed without much work. Lead time is removed because some tasks could be given low priority due to lack of manpower in a given period. Or, tasks could be labeled as not critical and the lead time of these tasks will effect the result.

\subsection {Sub variables}
\label{sec:bug}
To measure sub variables, the software program and SPSS was used. The program will generate throughput and churn as described in Sections \ref{sec:TP} and \ref{sec:churn}, one of the variables churn and throughput contains is "Type". The output from the program  when churn is taken into account will look like Table \ref{tab:ftb}. The output from the program will be used by SPSS. SPSS will use a function called case summaries, the case summaries function groups variables based on a common value.  With the case summaries function the variable "Team name", "Quarter" and "Type" will be grouped and the independent variable is churn. The result from case summaries will provide the sub variables.

\begin{table}[!ht]
\center
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | l | l | }
\hline
	\bf{Team name} & \bf{Churn} & \bf{Date} & \bf{Quarte}r & \bf{Type} \\ \hline
	Team one & 25 &2011-12-20& 2011-4 & Feature \\ \hline
	Team two & 3 &2012-04-19 & 2012-2 & bug \\ \hline
	Team one & 7 & 2010-08-06 & 2010-3 & Feature \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A excerpt from the result data produced by the program }
\label{tab:ftb} 
\end{table}

\subsection{Bugs finished, quarter}
\label{sub:sec:bfq} 
To get the statistics on number of bugs finished the same quarter as it was recorded the program and SPSS was used. The program extracted the "created date" and the "date to" values from each task and checks if their quarters match. If they do, a boolean value is set to true, otherwise it's set to false. The output is used in SPSS, where the boolean value is grouped together with "Team name" and "Quarter". After the SPSS has measured, the number of finished bugs are divided by the total in order to find the percentages of bugs finished within a quarter. 
\subsection{Average days backlog, bug}
\label{sub:sec:adbb}
To get the statistics on the average number of days bugs are in backlog per quarter, the program measures the number of days between the created date and the date from value. The number of days is saved together with the task. SPSS is used on the output of the program to measure the average days backlog for bugs variable.



\chapter{Results}                     
\label{ch:res}
The first correlation result showed a medium-high correlation relationship between \textit{team size} and both \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. Based on the correlation values, it was hard to find any evidence if WIP limit matter in software development. This resulted in a new analyze where each variable for each quarter was divided by the corresponding team size. 

Each section except Section \ref{sec:corr:tz} "Team size"  and Section \ref{sec:corr:alc} "All teams combined" is presented with two correlation tables and two corresponding descriptive statistics tables, one correlation table and descriptive statistic table for the first analyze and the same two tables are presented for the second analyze. {Team size} is presented with one correlation table and one descriptive statistic table, while all teams combined is represent with one correlation table for the two analyzes. The content of the sections will consist of highlighting the variables with a significant correlation and explain why sub variables differ. To back up any assumptions about the variables, descriptive statistic tables listed in Appendix \ref{app:DS} and correlation graphs will be used. 

\section{Correlation - WIP}
\label{sec:corr:WIP}
Table \ref{corr:WIP} shows the correlation tables for \textit{WIP}. The variables are shown vertically in the correlation table. Horizontally are the corresponding teams. The team names are shortened. Team one is shortened to T1, team two is shortened to T2 and so on.
The correlation Table \ref{corr:WIP} shows team one, three, four, six, seven, nine and ten has significant positive relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. \textit{Throughput feature} and \textit{throughput bug} is subset of \textit{throughput}. It's natural that these sub variables have a significant positive correlation to \textit{WIP}, when \textit{throughput} has. But, for team one, six, seven and ten that's not the case.

Both \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput feature} in team one's case has significant positive relationship with \textit{WIP}, while \textit{throughput bug} don't. \textit{Throughput} and \textit{throughput feature} has the correlation values 0.74 and 0.73, while \textit{throughput bug's} value is 0.02. The possible cause \textit{throughput bug} don't has a  significant correlation value with \textit{WIP}, while \textit{throughput} does, might be because \textit{throughput bug} consist of 37\% (108/290) of the \textit{throughput} dates, as shown in the total rows in Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:1} and \ref{DS:TPB:1}. But it's possible to have a close relationship although, since the correlation is based on the mean values. \textit{Throughput feature} has a total mean of 13.7, \textit{throughput bug} has the total mean of 6.4 and \textit{throughput} has the total mean of 11 as shown in Tables  \ref{DS:Throughput:1}, \ref{DS:TPFT:1} and \ref{DS:TPB:1}. The mean values strengthens the assumption that \textit{throughput feature} represents most of the \textit{throughput} variable. The correlation  graphs in Figure \ref{corr:Difference:1}  and \textit{throughput's} correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:TP} confirms the assumption. The pattern of dots in Figure \ref{fig:a:1} shows a significant positive correlation, while the dots in Figure \ref{fig:b:1} has no specific pattern which reflect the correlation value of 0.96 for \textit{throughput feature} and 0.03 for \textit{throughput bug}. %The throughput correlation table and the figure proves the assumption that  \textit{throughput feature} represents most of \textit{throughput} for team one.

\newpage
The same issue encounter for both team six and seven. In case of team six, both \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput feature} has significant positive relationship with WIP, while \textit{throughput bug} don't. \textit{Throughput}, \textit{throughput feature} and \textit{throughput bug} has the correlation values 0.64, 0.68 and 0.07. The total row in Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:6},  \ref{DS:TPFT:6} and \ref{DS:TPB:6}  shows \textit{throughput feature} consist of 609 dates and has a mean value of 4.8. While \textit{throughput bug} consist of 82 dates  and a mean value of 3.3. \textit{Throughput} consist of 691 dates and has a mean value of 4.58. The mean values and the number of dates strengthens the assumption that \textit{throughput feature} represents more of \textit{throughput} than \textit{throughput bug} does. The throughput correlation Table \ref{corr:TP} proves the assumption with \textit{throughput feature's}  correlation value of 0.99 and \textit{throughput bugs}  value of 0.04. 

For team seven's case, the difference between \textit{throughput}, \textit{throughput feature} and \textit{throughput bug} based on Table \ref{corr:WIP} is very small, which also can be assumed by the total row in Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:7},  \ref{DS:TPFT:7} and \ref{DS:TPB:7}. The total rows shows \textit{throughput} has a mean of 2.7, while \textit{throughput feature} has a mean value of 2.8 and \textit{throughput bug} has a mean value of 2.6. \textit{Throughput feature} contributes 156 dates to \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput bug} contributes 172 dates. Based on these numbers, it looks like both the sub variables contribute. The \textit{throughput} correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:TP} proves the assumption with values of .91 for both \textit{throughput feature} and \textit{bug}.  

Team ten has significant positive relationship between \textit{WIP} and both \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput bug}, but not for \textit{throughput feature}. \textit{Throughput} for team ten consist of 404 dates as show in the total row in Table \ref{DS:Throughput:7}. \textit{Throughput bug} represents 335 of these dates, while \textit{throughput feature} stands for the remaining 69 dates as shown in Tables \ref{DS:TPFT:7} and \ref{DS:TPB:7}. But the overall mean for \textit{throughput}, \textit{throughput feature} and \textit{throughput bug} is 2.2, 2.3 and 2.2, which could reflect a close relationship between these three variables. The throughput correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:TP} and the correlation graphs in Figures \ref{corr:Difference:10} disproves that assumption. The Figure \ref{fig:a:WIP:10} shows a vague significant positive correlation, while Figure \ref{fig:b:WIP:10} shows a significant positive correlation. The correlation table shows  \textit{throughput bug} with a correlation of 0.98 and \textit{throughput feature} with a correlation of 0.43.  Which proves that \textit{throughput bug} represents most of \textit{throughput}.

Team one, three, four and nine has a significant positive relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{bugs} as well. For team one, differ all the three churn variable from each other, based on the correlation Table \ref{corr:WIP}. \textit{Churn} has a value of 0.47, \textit{churn feature} has a value of 0.72 and \textit{churn bug} of 0.15.  Judging from these variables, it will look both \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn bug}  contribute to \textit{churn}. The descriptive statistic Tables \ref{DS:Churn:1}, A.4a and A.4b empower the assumption. The total mean of \textit{churn} is 20.2, while \textit{churn feature} has total mean of 24.5 and \textit{churn bug} has a total mean of 16.8. The descriptive statistic tables also shows that \textit{churn feature} contribute 150 dates to \textit{churn}, while \textit{churn bug} contribute 189 dates. The churn correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:churn} proves the assumption. Both \textit{churn feature} (0.57) and \textit{churn bug} (0.80) has a significant positive correlation to \textit{churn}. Judging from the correlation table from Section \ref{sec:corr:TP},  one can assume that correlation is not transitive. The paper "The Non-Transitivity of Pearson's Correlation Coefficient: An Educational Perspective" \parencite{corr:transitive} proves the assumption. 


\textit{Churn} and \textit{churn bug} has a significant negative correlation in team two's case. \textit{Churn feature} on the other hand has a correlation value of -0.25. According to the correlation values, one can assume that \textit{churn bug} represents most of \textit{churn}. The Tables \ref{DS:Churn:2}, \ref{DS:CF:2} and \ref{DS:CB:2} empower the assumption. \textit{Churn bug} contribute 521 dates and has a total mean value of 36.3. \textit{Churn feature} contribute 257 dates and has a mean value of 100.6. The total churn contains 778 dates and has a total mean of 57.6. The \textit{churn} correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:churn} proves the assumption. \textit{Churn bug} has the value of 0.70 and \textit{churn feature} has the value of 0.58. 

In team six's case, \textit{churn bug} has a positive correlation of 0.77, while both \textit{churn} and \textit{churn feature} has the values of -0.30 and -0.36. Based on these values, one can assume \textit{churn feature} represents most of \textit{churn}. The Tables \ref{DS:Churn:6}, \ref{DS:CF:6} and \ref{DS:CB:6} backs the theory. The tables shows \textit{churn feature} contribute 576 dates to \textit{churn} and has a total mean of 105.9. \textit{Churn bug} contains of 180 dates and has a total mean value of 73.8. \textit{Churn} has 756 dates and a total mean value of 98.3.  The churn correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:churn} proves the assumption of \textit{churn feature} represent most of \textit{churn}. One can see that \textit{churn feature} has a correlation value of 0.98, while \textit{churn bug} has a value of -0.02.

\textit{Throughput bug} for team five has a significant value of 0.54, while \textit{throughput} has a value of 0.52 and \textit{throughput feature} a value of 0.25. Based on these values, one can assume that \textit{throughput bug} represents most of \textit{throughput} for team five. The descriptive statistic Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:5}, \ref{DS:TPFT:5} and \ref{DS:TPB:5} shows the number of dates are 657 for \textit{throughput}. Out of the 657 dates, represents \textit{throughput feature} 108 dates, and \textit{throughput bug} 556 dates. These values also points towards the fact that \textit{throughput bug} represents most of \textit{throughput}. The overall mean for \textit{throughput} is 6.3, for \textit{throughput feature} it's 5.7 and for \textit{throughput bug} it is 6.4. Based on these values, it looks like both the sub variables contribute. The throughput correlation Table \ref{corr:TP} proves with the values 0.85 for \textit{throughput feature} and 0.99 for \textit{throughput bug} that both the sub variables contribute, but \textit{throughput feature} the most. 

Team one, four, five, seven and ten has a positive correlation \textit{WIP} and \textit{lead time}. Team four also has a positive correlation between each of the variables except \textit{team size}. Team eight has a significant correlation for \textit{throughput feature}, while \textit{throughput} don't. The \textit{throughput} relationship for team eight is explained in Section \ref{sec:corr:lt}.

The descriptive statistics tables in each section are based on summary of the correlation values. The tables shows number of values measured (N), mean, median, standard deviation (Std.dev), maximum (max)  and minimum (min) values from the correlation tables.
In Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP}, the mean correlation for \textit{throughput} and \textit{team size} is 0.6. The mean correlation value for \textit{lead time, throughput feature, throughput bug} is 0.5. The \textit{bug} variables has a mean correlation value of 0.4. The rest of the values have an mean value of 0.3 or less.

For team three is \textit{throughput bug} close to a significant positive correlation with a value of 0.52, while both \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput feature} has the values 0.57 and 0.71. With these correlation values, it looks like \textit{throughput bug} represents most of the \textit{throughput} variable. The descriptive statistic tables empower the assumption. \textit{Throughput} contains 542 dates and has a total mean value of 3.7. \textit{Throughput feature} represents 200 of these dates and has a mean value of 3.3, while \textit{throughput bug} represents the remaining 342 dates and has a total mean value of 4,  shown in tables \ref{DS:Throughput:3}, \ref{DS:TPFT:3} and \ref{DS:TPB:3}. The \textit{throughput} correlation Table \ref{corr:TP:V2} shows both sub variables contribute, but \textit{churn bug} contribute a little more with value of 0.98 for \textit{throughput bug} and a value of 0.90 for \textit{throughput feature}. 

Team four has a significant positive correlation for all the \textit{throughputs} variables, \textit{bugs finished, quarter}, \textit{lead time}, \textit{churn} and \textit{churn feature}.

For team eight differ \textit{churn feature} from \textit{churn} based on the correlation value in Table \ref{corr:WIP:V2}. The \textit{churn} relationship is stated in Section \ref{sec:corr:lt}. Team nine has a significant positive correlation for all \textit{throughput} variables. In the descriptive statistic Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}, \textit{throughput} has a average correlation value of 0.4 based on all the teams throughput variable, while rest of the variables except \textit{throughputs} sub variables has an average correlation values 0.2 or less.

\section{Correlation - Lead time}
\label{sec:corr:lt}

The Table  \ref{corr:lt} shows the correlation table for \textit{lead time}. Team one, four, five, seven and ten has a significant positive correlation between \textit{lead time} and \textit{WIP}. Team one also has a significant positive correlation between \textit{lead time} and all the variables except \textit{throughput bug}, \textit{avg days in backlog, bugs} and \textit{churn bug}. Both the sub variables; \textit{throughput bug} and \textit{churn bug} differ from respectively \textit{throughput} and \textit{churn}. \textit{Throughputs} relationship was stated in Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP} and \textit{churns} relationship was stated in Section \ref{sec:corr:bug}.   

The three \textit{churn} variables for team three have the correlation values of -0.45 for \textit{churn}, -0.27 for \textit{churn feature} and -0.64 for \textit{churn bug}. These values indicates more contribution from \textit{churn bug}  than \textit{churn feature}. The total dates and the mean from Tables \ref{DS:Churn:3}, \ref{DS:CF:3} and \ref{DS:CB:3} empower the assumption. The total \textit{churn} consist of 576 dates and a total mean of 61.8. \textit{Churn feature}  represents 205 of these dates and has a total mean of 98.9. \textit{Churn bug} answers for the remaining 371 dates and has a total mean of 41.4. The \textit{churn} correlation table in Section \ref{sec:corr:churn} proves the assumption. Still,  \textit{churn bug} has a correlation of 0.85, while the correlation value between \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn} is 0.90. The strong relationship between \textit{churn} and \textit{churn bug} shows that total dates and total mean can be used as an indicator of the relationship between variables, but it can't state it.

In both team four and eight's case, the variable \textit{churn bug} differ from \textit{churn} according to Table \ref{corr:lt}. The \textit{churn} variable representing team four has the correlation value of 0.97 and  \textit{churn bug} has the correlation value of 0.2. The Tables \ref{DS:Churn:4}, \ref{DS:CF:4} and \ref{DS:CB:4} shows that \textit{churn} consist of 574 dates. \textit{Churn bug} represents 78 of these dates while \textit{churn feature} represents the remaining 496 dates. \textit{Churn features} has the total mean of 8.4, \textit{churn bug's} mean is 1 and \textit{churn's} mean is 7.4. These variables clearly indicates the strong relationship between \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn}. The churn correlation Table \ref{corr:churn} verifies the theory with \textit{Churn feature} has the correlation value of 0.99 and \textit{churn bug} has the correlation value 0.13.



Team eight's \textit{churn bug} differ from \textit{churn} in shown in Table  \ref{corr:lt}. The correlation values between \textit{lead time} and \textit{churn} is 0.91, between \textit{lead time} and \textit{churn bug} it's  -0.12 and between \textit{lead time} and \textit{churn feature} it's 0.79. Based on these variables, it will look like \textit{churn feature} represents a greater part of the \textit{churn}. The Tables \ref{DS:Churn:8}, \ref{DS:CF:8} and \ref{DS:CB:8} indicates otherwise. \textit{Churn} is composed of 137 dates, and has a total mean of 13.4. \textit{Churn feature} represents 79 of these tasks and has a total mean of 17.4. \textit{Churn bug} represents the remaining 58 tasks and has a total mean of 8.  The values indicates both \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn bug} contribute to \textit{churn}. The Figure \ref{corr:Difference:lt:8} and correlation Table \ref{corr:churn} disapproves the assumption. The \textit{churn} correlation Table \ref{corr:churn} shows that \textit{churn feature} has the correlation of 0.84, while \textit{churn bug} has the value of -0.1. This is the same as shown in the correlation graphs. The Figure \ref{fig:a:lt:8} shows a clear positive correlation, while Figure \ref{fig:b:lt:8} shows no pattern and shows a correlation close to 0.

Team two's \textit{throughput feature} differ from \textit{throughput} based on the correlation values form Table \ref{corr:bug}. One could believe the reason is because \textit{throughput bug} consists of 2/3 of \textit{throughput's} (460/690) dates, as shown in the descriptive statistic Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:2} and \ref{DS:TPB:2}. But the two tables and Table \ref{DS:TPFT:2} shows that the total mean of \textit{throughput} is 4.39. While for \textit{throughput bug} it's 4.8 and 3.7 for \textit{throughput feature}. These three variables are quiet close, which could reflect that these three variables could be close, based on correlation measurement. 
But, the Figures in \ref{corr:Difference:2} and the throughput correlation table in \ref{sec:corr:TP} shows otherwise. The Figures \ref{fig:b:2} shows a significant positive correlation, while Figure \ref{fig:a:2} shows dots that are more randomly placed. The throughput correlation Table \ref{corr:TP} represents the same result with a value of 0.97 for \textit{throughput bug} and  0.1 for \textit{throughput feature}.

Team six, seven and nine has a significant positive correlation between the variable \textit{Bugs finished, quarter} and \textit{lead time}. Team nine also has a significant negative correlation between \textit{bug} and \textit{churn feature}, but not \textit{churn}. \textit{Churn feature} represents 201 of 538 dates as shown in Tables \ref{DS:Churn:9} and \ref{DS:CF:9}.  The total mean of \textit{churn feature} is 115.9, the total mean for \textit{churn} is 72.2 and the total mean for \textit{churn bug} is 46.1, as shown in the previous stated tables and Table \ref{DS:CB:10}. Judging from these numbers, both \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn bug} contribute to \textit{churn}. The Figure \ref{corr:Difference:9} shows the correlation values in a graph. One can see Figure \ref{fig:a:9} show a positive correlation. The Figure \ref{fig:b:9} represents a positive correlation, but not as high as Figure \ref{fig:a:9}. The churn correlation states the observations,  Table \ref{corr:churn} shows \textit{churn feature} correlation values is 0.60 and \textit{churn bug} correlation value is 0.39. This proves that both the sub variables of \textit{churn} contribute, with \textit{churn feature} the most.

Team nine has a significant positive correlation for \textit{throughput} and \textit{throughput bug}. The reason \textit{throughput feature} don't has a significant correlation while \textit{throughput} has it, in respect of the Table \ref{corr:Bugs:v2}, could be because \textit{throughput bug} represents most of the \textit{throughput} variable, as shown in Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:9}, \ref{DS:TPFT:9} and \ref{DS:TPB:9}. The \textit{throughput} variable contains 521 dates and has a mean value of 2.6. \textit{Throughput feature} represents 214 of these dates and has a total mean of 2.4, while \textit{throughput bug} represents the remaining 307 dates and has a total mean of 2.8. These variables indicates that both the \textit{throughput} sub variables contributes. The throughput correlation Table \ref{corr:TP:V2} proves that both the attributes contributes, but \textit{throughput bug} contributes the most with a correlation value of 0.95, while \textit{throughput feature} has a correlation value of 0.82. 

Team six has a significant positive correlation for \textit{throughput bug} and \textit{bugs finished quarter}, but not \textit{throughput}. The \textit{throughput} relationship were explained in Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP}.

\section {Correlation - Throughput}
\label{sec:corr:TP}
This section shows the correlation table between \textit{throughput} and the variables. Table \ref{corr:TP} shows that \textit{Throughput} has a significant correlation to either \textit{throughput feature} or \textit{throughput bug} for each of the teams. For team three, four, five, seven and nine, both the sub variables of \textit{throughput} have significant positive correlation to \textit{throughput}. For team one and six, \textit{throughput feature} differ from \textit{throughput}, the reason for that were explained in Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP}.   The Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP} also explain the \textit{throughput} relationship for team ten.   Team two's \textit{throughput} relationship is explained in Section \ref{sec:corr:bug}. Team one, three, four, six, seven, nine and ten has a positive correlation for \textit{WIP}. Team one, two, three, four and five has a significant correlation for \textit{bugs}.

Both team nine and ten has a positive significant correlation for \textit{bugs} and the \textit{bugs finished, quarter}. Team six has a significant correlation between for \textit{churn bug}. The \textit{churn} relationship were stated in Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP}.  The three \textit{Churn} variables differ in respect of Table \ref{corr:TP} for team one. The reason for this were stated in Section \ref{sec:corr:WIP}

For team eight differ \textit{throughput bug} from \textit{throughput}. \textit{Throughput bug} consist of 99 dates and the has total mean of 1.5. \textit{Throughput feature} consist of 92 dates and a total mean of 3.2. While \textit{throughput} has a total mean of 2.3 and a total of 191 dates. These numbers are gathered from the descriptive statistic Tables \ref{DS:Throughput:8}, \ref{DS:TPFT:8} and \ref{DS:TPB:8}.  On the basis of these numbers it will look like both of the sub variables of \textit{throughput} contributes and both of them should have close relationship to \textit{throughput}.  The Figure \ref{corr:Difference:8} shows otherwise. In Figure \ref{fig:a:8} are the dots moving in a upwards direction, hence positive correlation, while in Figure \ref{fig:b:8} almost all the dots are all gathered around the low values of Y. The Figures in \ref{corr:Difference:8} reflects the correlation value 0.94 for \textit{throughput feature} and 0.44 for \textit{throughput bug}.

\textit{Churn bug} for team five has a significant positive correlation of .94, while \textit{churn feature} has the correlation value of 0.2. This proves that \textit{churn bug} represents most of \textit{churn}. The Tables \ref{DS:Churn:5}, \ref{DS:CF:5} and \ref{DS:CB:5} shows the same result. \textit{Churn} consist of 698 dates and has a total mean of 33.4, while \textit{churn feature} and \textit{churn bug} represents has 123 dates and 575 dates. The total mean of \textit{churn feature} is 52.1 and for \textit{churn bug} it's 29.4. 

For team ten has \textit{churn bug} the correlation value of .94 while \textit{churn feature} has the value .14. This shows that churn bug represents most of \textit{churn}.  Based on the Tables \ref{DS:Churn:10}, \ref{DS:CF:10} and \ref{DS:CB:10}, one can see that \textit{churn} contains 361 dates and has a total mean value of 45.4. \textit{Churn feature} represents 69 of these dates and has a total mean of 75.5, while \textit{churn bug} represents 292 of \textit{churn's} dates and has a total mean of 38.3. These data also shows a close indication of the relationship between \textit{churn} and \textit{churn bug}.  


\textit{Churn feature} for team seven has the correlation value of .91 while \textit{churn bug} has the correlation value 0.13. The descriptive statistic Tables \ref{DS:Churn:7}, \ref{DS:CF:7} and \ref{DS:CB:7} shows that \textit{churn} contains 359 dates and has a total mean of 77.3.  \textit{Churn feature} represents 141 of these dates, and has a total mean of 121.2 .  \textit{Churn bug} represents the 218 remaining dates and has a total mean of 48.9. Based on these values, one could assume that both  \textit{churn feature} and  \textit{churn bug} contribute to  \textit{churn}, but the churn correlation table disapproves that. Which once again shows that the descriptive statistic tables can be used as indication of relationship, but can't prove them. The Figure \ref{fig:a:7} shows clearly the significant positive relationship between \textit{churn} and \textit{churn feature}.

\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:dis}
In this chapter a discussion based on the research questions, the different results from this study and what literature says is presented. 

\section{WIP and throughput} 
\vspace{-0.5em}
In this thesis, throughput is a measure to see how productive teams are. In Section \ref{WIPsec}, there was stated by various people, when lowering WIP-limit, throughput increases. The data from this study shows otherwise. Both Tables \ref{DS:corr:TP} and \ref{DS:corr:TP:v2} proves that if \textit{WIP} increase, so does \textit{throughput}. \textit{Throughput} has the average correlation value of 0.6 when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account and 0.4 otherwise. One can argue that the throughput correlation value is biased when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, based on the strong team size correlation. But the Table \ref{DS:corr:TP:v2}, where team size is taken into account shows a average correlation value of 0.4 between \textit{throughput} and \textit{WIP} when team size is taken into account.

When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account,  all of teams have a positive correlation between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}, and seven of the teams have a significant correlation value, shown in Table \ref{corr:WIP}.  When team size is taken into account the Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}  shows nine out of ten teams have a positive correlation between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. Team ten is the only team with a negative correlation.  Team five, six, eight and ten has low correlation, team one and seven has a low-medium relationship, team two, three, four and nine has a significant linear relationship. The median between the teams when team size is \textbf{not} taking into account is 0.7 and 0.4 otherwise. The standard deviation is 0.2 when team size is \textbf{not} taking into account and 0.3 otherwise, shown by Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP} and \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}.  The median and standard deviation when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account shows most of the teams has a strong linear relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. The median and standard deviation when team size is taken into account shows that more than half of the teams has a medium or high linear relationship.

The combined Table \ref{corr:All} shows a significant correlation value of 0.41 when team size is \textbf{not} taking into account, while Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows a overall correlation of 0.05 when team size is taken into account. The \textit{throughput} values shows that when team size is \textbf{not} taking into account, seven of the ten teams has a significant linear relationship and the average \textit{throughput} value is 0.6. When team size is taken into account, four of the teams has a significant correlation and the average mean is 0.4. This values shows that \textit{throughput} has a positive correlation relationship with \textit{WIP}. The two median numbers shows at least 50\% of the correlation values has a medium-strong correlation value. The standard deviation shows a low-medium spread between the values, which indicates that the values are in the same range. The overall correlation value when team size is \textbf{not} taking into account shows a positive medium-strong linear relationship, but when team size is taken into consideration the overall linear relationship is 0.05, but the average for teams is 0.4 and four out of ten teams has a significant value.  Based on this, there is a low-medium linear relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. 


The \textit{throughput} correlation tables in Section \ref{sec:corr:TP} shows that \textit{bugs} and \textit{throughput feature} has an average correlation value of 0.6, \textit{lead time} has the average value of 0.5 and \textit{throughput bug} has a value of 0.8, shown by Table \ref{DS:corr:TP:v2}. 
The combine Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows \textit{throughput} has significant correlation values to all variables except \textit{WIP} and \textit{churn feature}, when team size is taken into account.

When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account the Table \ref{DS:corr:TP} shows that \textit{WIP} has an average correlation value of 0.6, \textit{throughput feature} has a value of 0.8, \textit{throughput bug} has an average value of 0.7, \textit{bugs} has a value of 0.6 and both \textit{lead time} and \textit{team size} has an average correlation value of 0.5. The combined Table \ref{corr:All} shows \textit{throughput} has a significant correlation relationship to \textit{WIP, throughput feature, throughput bug, bugs}, \textit{bugs finished, quarter} and \textit{churn}. These correlation values can't be used to see the impact of WIP-limits. 

The \textit{throughput's} correlation values are isolated and can only be used to see what impact \textit{throughput} has on a software process. One cannot say if \textit{WIP} increases, then \textit{throughput} increases and then all the variables with a significant positive correlation to \textit{throughput} increases. The \textit{throughput} correlation values also shows the \textit{WIP} relationship decreases when \textit{team size} is taken into account, but the relationship between the other variables don't differ that much.


\section{WIP and lead time}
\vspace{-1em}
As stated in Section \ref{sec:in:lt}, lead time could be used to track how quickly software is delivered to customers . Each development process would like to get their lead time as low as possible. In Section \ref{WIPsec} there is stated that WIP-limits are important to reduce lead times. The result from this thesis when team size was \textbf{not} taken into account shows average linear relationship of 0.5 between \textit{WIP} and \textit{lead time} across the teams, shown in Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP}.  Team one, four, five, seven and ten has significant positive linear relationship and both team two and three has a medium correlation relationship as shown in Table \ref{corr:WIP}. 

The result from when team size was taken into account shows a average linear relationship of 0.2, which is a weaker linear relationship than when team size was \textbf{not} taken into account. Three of the ten teams have a significant positive correlation, while the rest of teams correlation values varies from -0.18 to 0.32, as shown by Tables \ref{corr:WIP:V2} and \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}. 

The standard deviation shows a variation of 0.2 and a median of 0.5 when team is \textbf{not} taken into account. The standard deviation when team size is taken into account is 0.4 and the median is 0 as shown in Tables  \ref{DS:corr:WIP} and \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}. The standard deviation shows a high proliferation of values, which shows evidence of spread relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{lead time} across the teams for when team size is taken into account.   The standard deviation value of 0.2 shows that  each of the ten \textit{lead time} values are closer when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account.  

The combine correlation Table \ref{corr:All} shows that all teams combined have a significant correlation value of 0.27, when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account.  The correlation Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows a non-significant correlation value of 0.05 when team size is taken into account. The value presented in this section shows when time size is taken into account, there is no linear relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{lead time}. When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, there is a low significant correlation value for all the teams combined and medium-strong positive correlation when one measure each team. Either way, based on these results, there is no evidence showing that \textit{WIP} limit will decrease \textit{lead time}, its more likely to decrease \textit{lead time}.


Despite the relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{lead time},  \textit{lead time} has a close positive relationship to four of the five individual variables, shown in Table \ref{DS:corr:LT:v2}. \textit{Throughput}, \textit{Bugs} and  \textit{Bugs finished, quarter}  has the average correlation value 0.5, while \textit{churn} has the value of 0.4 when time size is taken into account. When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput} has an average correlation value of 0.5 and \textit{throughput feature} has the value 0.4, while the rest variables has a value of 0.3 or less. The Table \ref{corr:All} shows a overall significant positive correlation between \textit{lead time} and both \textit{team size} and \textit{WIP}. When team size is taken into account \textit{throughput}, \textit{throughput bug}, \textit{bugs}, \textit{bugs finished quarter}, \textit{avg days in backlog, bugs}, \textit{churn} and \textit{churn feature} has a significant positive correlation. These values shows the impact \textit{lead time} has on a development process.  The significant correlation value and the high average correlation value between \textit{lead time} and \textit{throughput} is odd, these values should be further investigated. 

\section{WIP and bugs}
To minimize bugs should be a goal independent of software process and methods. If WIP-limit could reduce bugs without compromising, one could conclude that WIP-limit matter in software development. The article cited by Shinkle stated; when WIP was too high, the number of bugs increased  \parencite{Shinkle}.

When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, the average correlation value between \textit{WIP} and \textit{bugs} is 0.4 and four of the teams have a significant positive correlation value between \textit{bugs} and \textit{WIP}. All ten teams have a positive correlation value, as shown in Table \ref{corr:WIP}. The two variable \textit{bug finished, quarter} and \textit{avg days backlog bugs} is used as a side measure to how long bugs are in backlog and the amount of bugs fixed vs. the amount of bugs recorded in system per quarter. The average correlation value across teams for \textit{bug finished, quarter} is 0.3 and \textit{avg days backlog bugs} is 0.1. The value \textit{bug finished, quarter} shows a low-medium linear relationship. The 0.1 correlation value of  \textit{avg days backlog bugs}  shows that in average \textit{WIP} limit has no influence on the number of days bugs are in backlog. But both \textit{bugs} and \textit{bug finished, quarter} shows a average medium linear relationship.

When team size is taken into account, the average correlation value is 0.2, shown by Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}.  Eight out of ten teams have a positive correlation relationship, but only one team has a significant positive value. The  \textit{bug finished quarter} and \textit{avg days backlog, bugs}  has the average correlation values 0.2 and -0.1. 

The standard deviation when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account is 0.2 and the median is 0.5. The median when team size is taken into account is 0.2, while the standard deviation is increased by 0.1. The median numbers shows significant impact of team size between the relationship of \textit{WIP} and \textit{bug}. The standard deviation values for the two cases shows a minor variation between the two results variables, shown in \ref{DS:corr:WIP} and \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2}    

When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, the overall correlation value is significant with a value of  0.41, shown in Table \ref{corr:All}.  The correlation Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows the correlation values from when time size is taken into account. The table shows a overall correlation value of 0.12. The values from this section shows that when team size is taken into account, the correlation relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{bugs} is small and medium if team size is \textbf{not} taken into account. The correlation values are also widely spread when team size is taken into account. Based on this, there is no evidence of that WIP-limit helps increase or decrease bugs when team size is taken into account.  


The \textit{bug} correlation tables in Section  \ref{sec:corr:bug} shows the \textit{bugs} variable has a average correlation of 0.6 to \textit{throughput} and a correlation value of 0.3 to \textit{bugs finished, quarter} \textit{avg days backlog, bugs}, \textit{lead time} and \textit{team size}. When team size is taken into account, \textit{bugs} has a average correlation value of 0.6 to \textit{throughput} again, \textit{bugs finished quarter} has the average correlation value 0.5, \textit{avg days in backlog, bugs} has the average value of 0.4, \textit{lead time} 0.5 and \textit{churn} 0.3. When team size is taken into account, the linear relationship between the variables and \textit{bugs} increases for almost each variable.
 

\section{WIP and Churn}
Churn is used as surrogates for effort in this thesis. It turns out based on the results, independently of  team size, there is no relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{churn} or the sub variables of churn. The results shows respectively an average correlation of -0.1 in Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP:v2} and 0 in Table \ref{DS:corr:WIP}. When team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, two of the teams has a significant correlation, one of them has a positive correlation and the other has a negative. When team size is taken into account, there is one team with a significant correlation and that correlation is positive. 

The standard deviation for both the results are 0.4, while the median is 0.1 when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account and -0.1 for the other case. The standard deviation empower the assumption of a relationship between \textit{churn} and \textit{WIP}, since the values are spread and their is no pattern.  The Table \ref{corr:All} shows a overall correlation value of 0.06 when team size is taken into account. The Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows a correlation value of -0.07. These values also shows that \textit{WIP}-limit has no impact on \textit{churn}.

In Section \ref{sec:corr:churn}, when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, \textit{churn} has no linear relationship between any of the other variables, if the \textit{churn's} sub variables are disregard, as shown in Table \ref{DS:corr:Churn}. When  team size is taken into account, \textit{bugs finished, quarter} has a strong average relationship with a value of 0.6, while \textit{lead time} has a value of 0.4 which, shown in Table \ref{DS:corr:churn:v2}. Based on the combine Table \ref{corr:All}, \textit{churn} has a significant positive correlation value to both the sub variables and a significant negative correlation to \textit{team size}. When team size is taken into account, \textit{churn} has a significant positive correlation to \textit{throughput}, \textit{throughput bug}, \textit{bugs}, \textit{bugs finished, quarter}, \textit{avg days in backlog, bugs}, \textit{lead time} and \textit{churn bug}. 



\section{Team size}
As the different results sections in Chapter \ref{ch:res} and the sections above states, it's important to take team size into account when a case study like this is conducted. If team size were left out as a variable in this case study, \textit{WIP} would have a  average linear relationship of 0.6 with \textit{throughput}, 0.4 with \textit{bugs} and 0.4 with \textit{lead time}. These three correlation values decreased by 0.2 compared to when  team size was taken into account. The combine correlation Table  \ref{corr:All} shows that seven of the variables has a significant positive correlation with \textit{team size}. The table also shows eight out of eleven variables has a significant correlation value with \textit{WIP}, while Table \ref{corr:All:V2} shows one out of ten variables has a significant relationship, when team size is taken into account. If team size was not taken into account the result from this thesis would have been biased. 


\iffalse
When time size was \textbf{not} taken into account for the \textit{throughput} variable, \textit{bugs} has a value of 0.6 and \textit{lead time} has a value of 0.5, which indicates a medium - strong relationship. The median in \textit{bugs} case is 0.8 and for \textit{lead time} it's 0.5 as shown in Tables \ref{DS:corr:TP} and \ref{DS:corr:TP:v2}. When team size is taken into account, the correlation values between \textit{throughput} and both \textit{bugs} and \textit{lead time} is the same, the standard deviation and median for \textit{bugs} is different.  If \textit{WIP} omitted, the correlation relationship between the other variables and \textit{throughput} don't differ to much.

The \textit{bugs} correlation tables \ref{DS:corr:Bugs} and \ref{DS:corr:Bugs:v2} shows a difference in the correlation value between \textit{bugs} and \textit{WIP}. The correlation value is increased by 0.2 when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account. Both the \textit{throughput} correlation values are 0.6. The correlation value for \textit{lead time} is also increased by 0.2 when team size is \textbf{not} taken into account, while churn increased by 0.3. These values show an impact of team size on the correlation relationship for 3 of 4 variables. For \textit{lead time} increases the churn value by 0.2 when time size is \textbf{not} taken into account, otherwise are the correlation values for \textit{lead time} stated preceding paragraphs.

\section{WIP}
The article "Studying Lean-Kanban Approach Using Software Process Simulation" \parencite{DavidAnderson} simulated a  lean-kanban process as stated in \ref{WIPsec}. The simulation showed when WIP was limit, the software process used 100 days and 120 otherwise. The article "Simulation of software maintenance process, with and without a work-in-process limit" \parencite{SMR:SMR1599} showed that WIP-limit can lead to improvement in throughput. The article also showed that when taking a process without WIP-limit, and simulate it using WIP-limit it outperformed the original process. The result from this thesis shows otherwise. The result from this thesis shows overall four out of ten teams have a significant positive correlation to \textit{throughput} when team size is taken into account and seven out of ten otherwise.
 
\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conc}
In this thesis the main goal was to investigate the research question "Does WIP limit in software development matter?".  If so, "how can one find the optimal WIP-limit" and "Which parameters should be considered in order to optimize WIP-limits".  To answer the research questions a data set from a company called Software Innovation were interpreted. The data set is based on metadata about tasks from 2010 to 2013.

In light of the previous findings, the results from when team size was \textbf{not} taken into account are discarded. Since the data showed evidence of bias regarding team size. The difference between the correlation tables in Chapter \ref{ch:res} proved that.


If WIP limit matters in software development some of its benefits should be to reduce bugs, increase throughput, decrease lead time etc. Based on the results from the case study, \textit{WIP} has an medium impact on \textit{throughput} on team level. The results shows a positive linear relationship between \textit{WIP} and \textit{throughput}. The previous research has stated to lower WIP to decrease throughput, which this case study disapproves. The overall correlation value of \textit{WIP} shows one significant correlation. The significant correlation a negative one for \textit{bugs finished, quarter}. Since WIP - limits don't matter in software development based on this study, there is no need to find an optimal WIP-limit or know which parameters to take into account in order to optimize WIP. 

However, the results from this paper show some other findings. The importance of taking team size into account when measuring a similar research, the churn variable has no or little impact on the software process and the great impact the variables \textit{lead time}, \textit{bugs} and \textit{throughput} has in a software process. 
%The values of this data, example lead time has a close relationship between order empower this validity of this study

\section{Future work}
The conclusion from this thesis is made on one case study. I would recommend doing the same calculation as in this thesis with another data set and comparing the outcome. I would also suggest an different approach as looking more deeply into the relationship between \textit{WIP} and  \textit{team size}. I suggest one measure the number of employees working on each task instead of take the number of employees per quarter and divide on the mean of each variables value.

I will also suggest looking at the values up against release dates. The number of WIP's, throughput, bugs et cetera usually decrease around release date, which could cause bias in the data. There is also done another research on the data from SI, I would suggest comparing the results.
